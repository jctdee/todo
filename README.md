To Do List project for The Odin Project

Not using webpack for this project since it takes some time to setup. Will be learning React soon anyway.

Will use proper Tab Navigation for my next projects.

Not configured for mobile. Will be learning drop-down menus in the next lesson and will start applying there.

// MISTAKE LIST:
Should've stored all dueDate values in local storage with the same format of date input format then
used dateFormatter on creating the HTML element.. 

Will not do 'This Week' since I messed up on the date format. Will be time-consuming to start from scratch.
